    message: "🚨 CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TESTING COMPLETED - CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES FOUND! Comprehensive testing of the Content Management System after Go binary rebuild reveals significant implementation problems: ❌ MAJOR FINDINGS: While CMS endpoints are now accessible (proving binary was rebuilt), the implementation has critical issues: DATABASE SCHEMA PROBLEMS: SEO content has NULL handling issues causing 500 errors, Legal documents have unique constraint violations REQUEST VALIDATION ISSUES: All admin creation endpoints fail due to mismatched field names and validation requirements - Banner expects 'LinkURL'/'Type', Email Template expects JSONMap for variables, Campaign expects 'Subject'/'EmailTemplate', SEO expects 'PageType'/'MetaTitle', FAQ expects 'Name' instead of 'title' MISSING SAMPLE DATA: All endpoints return empty arrays indicating sample data insertion failed ROUTING ISSUES: FAQ sections endpoint returns 404 instead of 401 for unauthorized access ✅ WORKING ASPECTS: Public APIs mostly functional (75% success), Validation and security working well (89% success), Admin authentication working ❌ OVERALL SUCCESS RATE: 47.1% (16/34 tests passed). The CMS system has been deployed but requires significant fixes to request structures, database schema, and sample data insertion before being production-ready."
